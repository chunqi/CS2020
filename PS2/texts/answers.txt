1.b MyFastList algorithm
Sort the array (after each add or use a better insertion algorithm)
Do binary search on the array (should be beast case w/o for random access)

1.d
Firstly it prevents storing of negative numbers in the list.
Secondly the negations also take up extra space
The negated numbers also do not represent actual elements, rather lack thereof
