1.b MyFastList algorithm
1000 buckets to represent the presence of each possible element. Constant time add and search.
Elements must be between 0 - 999

1.d
Firstly it prevents storing of negative numbers in the list.
Secondly the negations also take up space and does not represent actual elements, instead it represents the lack thereof
